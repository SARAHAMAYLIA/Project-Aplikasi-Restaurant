Server API for seller locations (development)

Steps to run locally:

1. Install Node.js (v16+/v18+ recommended).
2. Open a terminal and change to the server folder:

   cd server

3. Install dependencies:

   npm install

4. Start the server:

   npm start

5. The API will be available at:

   http://localhost:3000/api/locations

Notes:
- This is a small development server that returns the static dummy locations used by the app.
- Keep your production API keys and credentials out of source control.
